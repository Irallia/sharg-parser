See the documentation on [API stability](https://docs.seqan.de/seqan/3-master-user/about_api.html) to learn about
when API changes are allowed.

<!--
The following API changes should be documented as such:
  * a previously experimental interface now being marked as stable
  * an interface being removed
  * syntactical changes to an interface (e.g. renaming or reordering of files, functions, parameters)
  * semantic changes to an interface (e.g. a function's result is now always one larger) [DANGEROUS!]

If possible, provide tooling that performs the changes, e.g. a shell-script.
